# COugh

This was a demo for a TAFE project about creating a game mechanic.  
The game mechanic we came up with was that you can have clones of yourself that are locked in the same relative position as you. Think of the Double Cherry powerup from Super Mario 3D World, but the clones can never get further or closer to eachother. If one clone hits a wall, all clones stop moving. If one clone lands on the ground, all clones stop falling.

We also had to gather feedback for the demo. The main things were that the jumping was a bit too floaty, and the "hook" of the levels' puzzles were kind of hard to figure out.

...and no, I don't remember why it's called "COugh". I think it was kind of whatever because we didn't think this would ever be seen outside of the TAFE project.

The credits at the end of the demo video below don't mention who did what, so here it is:

- I did the programming
- Nat did the Robot Dog and animation
- Corey did the 3D Modelling
