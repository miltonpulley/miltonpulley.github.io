# Project Named Tower

This was one of the really big projects at TAFE. We had to make a multiplayer game for mobile.  
It was a two-player attack/defend tower defense game, which played like Plants Vs. Zombies but with the layout of Bloons.

There were teams of four, but our group had... ""five"". The teacher told us that two of these members assigned to us were absolutely not going to pull the weight of one person, let alone two. Truth be told, I don't think I ever saw either of them, certainly not during the project. So it was really a three-member group. Then the person who was handling the deployment to mobile evaporated.

So it was just me doing the game, and the person who was handling the client-server communication (I had a hand in that too).

I have yet to get footage of the game actually playing as it is two-player, but I do have footage of one player joining the server:
