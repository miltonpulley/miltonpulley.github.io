Hold on to your socks, 'cause THIS... is **ARMLEGEDDON**!

ARMLEGEDDON is a nonstop VR rogue-like where you are an action figure that can switch out your weaponised limbs, fighting past sentient toys to get to the end of the toybox as fast as possible, while dealing with a slowly-decreasing health bar.
