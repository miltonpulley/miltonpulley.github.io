Hold on to your socks, 'cause THIS... is **ARMLEGEDDON**!

ARMLEGEDDON is a nonstop VR rogue-like where you are an action figure that can switch out your weaponised limbs, fighting past sentient toys to get to the end of the toybox as fast as possible, while dealing with a slowly-decreasing health bar.

For ARMLEGEDDON, many meetings involved discussing with our creative director during development for the procedural level generation, and some playtesting during the beta and soft launch.
I wanted to make it as easy as possible for our creative director to add new rooms.
We landed on it being linear with hand-crafted rooms, with certain categories of rooms appearing more or less frequently depending on the level.

This is one of the enemies in the game that I modelled, called the "Gutterby". It's basically a gutted furby head that shoots lasers out of its eyes. Peturbing!
