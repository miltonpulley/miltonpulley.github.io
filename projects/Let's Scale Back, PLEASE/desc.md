Done for the GMTK Game Jam 2024 in 48 Hours.

## The Game & How To Play

You are the project manager of a game company, and the build needs to be finalized before release day.

Balance Quality, Resources and Money to keep the project within scope. Keep in mind, you have to constantly pay wages, and no benefit is free.

With over 50 lines for your employees to approach you with, who knows how this game will turn out? Make good choices, take care of your employees, and always remember: Cheryl lives in the walls!

## Background

Picture this: It's the ancient times known as 2023, and the GMTK Game Jam is glowing over the horizon. An air of anticipation washes over you as Unity projects are created and photoshop files are opened, but unfortunately, two words worm their way into your mind:

Gravitational mechanics.

Last year, we tried to do the impossible, and failed miserably. Scope creep got the best of us, and even though people saying the game had potential, it turns out that orbital mechanics are not the most intuitive thing.

So now that the fourth wall is firmly broken, we naturally made a game about making a game.
