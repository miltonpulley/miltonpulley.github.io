# Creative Process of the Portfolio Website

## 30th of January 2025

I finally decided to create a website portfolio during the break between University terms. A portfolio had been something I planned to make ever since many at TAFE (and many since) have pointed out the benefits of one.

My University's IT faculty had a conference day of sorts during the end-of-year holidays where, among other things, attended a presentation of creating a portfolio. From there I got the idea to use Github Pages, to reflect on assessments, show what didn't work and why, problem solving, teamwork, communication, and not so much on technical prowess. The presentation also showed "Beautiful Jekyll", which helps to quickly construct a website, but I chose to write my own HTML/CSS/JS.

I didn't need to make this website myself but I thought it would be a fun exercise, and because I can (and also I prefer total control over the underlying functionality, which is why I would rather write my own video game engine rather than an off-the-shelf one).

## 31st of January, 2025

I have yet to figure out how to do things like css animation, but I'll figure it out when it comes to it.

Some of the JavaScript was from a project that gradually built up while I was learning HTML/CSS/JS. I probably won't do a datastore with SQL since that feels a bit overkill, I'll probably just fetch from file.

The filtering being done by buttons and not a searchbar is because I currently do not feel like sanitising inputs and protecting against injection attacks (even though I'm sure other attacks are still possible, assuming Github Pages doesn't already protect against that stuff anyway).  

The main priority is getting the site in a workable state, as I only have 4 weeks (which is plenty of time but I don't want to get sidetracked and fall victim to scope-creep).

At the end of the day I had finished displaying the project list, read from a .json file.

## 1st of February, 2025

I'm not particularly liking the amount of hardcoded strings due to differing files, e.g. referencing an HTML tag with `id=X` and in JavaScript with `.getElementById(X)`.
Both `X`'s are the same, and should be in a variable for easy editing, but they appear in different files in different languages.  
I'll have to find a way to reference variables across HTML and JavaScript files, although that doesn't sound very doable. I have finished the functionality of filtering by tags, including a whitelist and blacklist.

At the end of the day, I happened to bring up this website while on call with my Mum. As she has had experience in websites and I have conducted video game playtesting, she had a look and gave some feedback on things I didn't even consider, such as the black background of the "Blacklist All" button made it look like it was "currently selected", even though it doesn't "stay selected".  
I am honestly getting ahead of myself to be doing the css before finishing full functionality, so I wrote down what Mum said and I will work on it after functionality.  
This is why playtesting, User Experience (UX), and even customer requirements elicitation are important.

## 2nd of February, 2025

I took the sunday off.

## 3rd of February, 2025

I Added full functionality to the buttons that will (eventually) make the project expand to fill the screen, giving more detail on each project. This involved CSS animation, which was quite easy to pick up.

I also reorganised my JavaScript code that runs when the window is first loaded, including HTML generation and button functionality.

Regrettably, these two things were done in the same commit. It definitely would have been better to have them seperate, but I ended up getting sidetracked/carried away while writing the project expand button functionality.

When the project expands to fill the screen, I'm thinking it could have an area that could display different kinds of things (and not just images) because a lot of these projects could be interacted with, i.e. spinning 3D models that can have wireframe so my topology can be seen, or music I've composed could be played, etc.  
I probably won't write most of these as I'm sure many people have already gone through and designed these things on the internet.

Any tool I create for adding entries of new projects probably won't be very complex, and might not even be more than just writing extra HTML to be loaded from a file. If it does become tedious enough then I will, and I'll write the current system in a way that can be swapped out easily, just in case (note that if improperly done or unchecked will obviously lead to a slew of hacks, attacks and exploits).

There was some unfinished experimenting I have done, but won't commit because of its dirty, messy, experimental, chicken-scratch, off-the-back-of-the-napkin nature.

## 4th of February, 2025

I'll be honest, today I didn't do anything. I *could* have just as easily lied that I was otherwise occupied, but... well I feel like there is some sort of validity as to why I slacked, and therefore a motive against lying (A don't-lie-because-not-guilty sort of situation).

Sure, I did have a slow start to the day but I was fine by ~1pm. Rather, with some basic risk assessment, I gave myself the deadline of the 24th of february as that is when my university term starts. This would mean I have ~13-16 days, depending on how many days of each weekend I take off. I have let's say... 50-75% of the total work done in 4 days (30th, 31st, 1st, 3rd). I feel *quite* confident that I can get this finished in time.  
If this were a group project or something I would get paid for then no question I would be on it, but this is a solo project with much wiggle room.

Also, if one would think I should've taken Saturday the 1st of February off, then you could consider this day to be effectively that.

In other news, I found out there (apparently) will be a blackout tommorow from 7am to 5pm, although just means that I cannot use the internet as a resource. I can still work on the project as Visual Studio Code has an [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) that can host the website from my computer, which is how I have been seeing real time changes to my HTML/CSS/JS.

## 5th of February, 2025

Just implemented the CSS animation of expanding/shrinking of the projects from the project list, although the illusion is broken when you scroll while shrinking. It (in theory) is easy enough to fix by, while shrinking, continuously updating the end size/position (via the four `--expandproject-to-X` variables), but would have to be done asynchronously and would have to constantly check the progress of the animation.  
I don't really know when I'll get around to fixing it since it has a lower priority than continuing to implement functionality.

I feel like any part of the program I write that makes CSS and JS interact is awfully messy, but I don't really see any better way to do how I'm doing it (otherwise I would obviously do the better way).  
I feel like this is because CSS is kind of an all-over-the-place language that is sometimes vauge and unintuitive in what things do, but I suppose I'd rather have CSS than putting the styling directly into HTML like pre-CSS.

I have decided to instead of having many project viewers with one each per project in the project list, only the animation will be, and the singular actual viewer always stays the same size on screen, just changes visibility. This means that the project viewer has to change its inner HTML to match the currently viewed project.  
I have decided to do this because there will be less everything to load, and it means I can decouple the viewer from the project list.

## 6th of February, 2025

I overslept by 3 HOURS today, waking up at 11am (I usually get up at 9 but I've been getting up at 8 recently, most likely due to less physical exertion over the holidays). I don't know what is happening, I haven't overslept for ***YEARS***, but then suddenly overslept twice.

Nevertheless I still pressed on with the project, even though the project viewer is the most complicated part of the project, mainly because I haven't done "be-able-to-load-anything" in HTML/CSS/JS before.  
I have some ideas on how I could do it, such as loading the entire project viewer's inner HTML from file, meaning I would write different HTML for each project.

Another thing I will have to think about is protecting against attacks, hacks and exploits. I still need to do more research on this, but since the website is read-only from the client's end, attacks to the server should in theory be eliminated. I *think* this will protect against client-to-client-via-server attacks like XSS, but again I need to do more research.  
Yes I should've been thinking about attacks, hacks and exploits from the start but the chances of a malicious someone coming across this website... maybe EVER is astronomically low.

A good solution to all of this (besides the anomalous oversleeping) is using LIT components, which I probably should've started with in the first place since I have been taught in it.  
LIT components would automatically handle a lot of vulnerability protection like sanitising inputs, and would be a good way to generate the project viewer.  
I will probably switch over to LIT components.

## 7th of February, 2025

Finished converting the project list to use LIT elements. It was a bit of a hassle, which is why I decided not to put the filter-tags-to-LIT conversion in the same commit.  
It's annoying that LIT doesn't like to have external CSS, and prefers you put all of it in a static field in the LIT element class, meaning CSS syntax doesn't work without some VSCode extension that I have yet to look for.

I originally had the CSS linked in the LIT's `render()` function, but is now is in the LIT class `static styles = [""]` for compatibility and other reasons.  
In order to not have the JavaScript files be massive, and to make the conversion easier, the css is loaded from another JavaScript file which is just the original CSS file but with each LIT component's CSS wrapped in `export const X = css``;` to make them LIT `css` strings.

Another thing that this seemed to fix was that editing the CSS file wasn't applying to the [VSCode Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) without me reloading the page, instead of it applying when saving the file like usual.

## 8th of February, 2025

Took a break and hung out with some friends.

## 9th of February, 2025

Took a break.

## 10th of February, 2025

After a bit more work, continuing on what I didn't finish on the 7th, I have finally converted the filter area and the project list to LIT components. The project viewer has yet to be converted, but it only exists as ~1-3 lines of code at the moment.  
Again, I probably should've started with LIT but for some reason I didn't. I guess I forgot about the security part.

Just reorganised some of the project, including reordering the functions in each JavaScript file to be consistent, and turning every `<ul>` into `<div>` and removing every `<li>` in the LIT components since even though they were all still unordered lists, the CSS `flex` was doing all the layout.

## 11th of February, 2025

Currently in the middle of fiddling with the project viewer, and dynamically fetching an unknown amount of any kind of file. I currently am not going to write my own file-to-html parsers for various reasons, so I'll be using online libraries. Eventually I will write my own parsers for the sake of challenge and independance of 3rd-party code (maybe one day I'll even drop LIT!), but that's not on the agenda to be done before the 24th.

Currently I am trying to find a parser that makes markdown convert to HTML, and I have, but nothing yet that directly works with LIT other than LIT's `unsafeHTML(``)` directive. I would like this as LIT is the thing doing much in the way of security right now.  
Funnily enough, Markdown would most likely be the easiest kind of file for me to write a file-to-HTML converter for (besides plain text files and other HTML files), since Markdown and HTML are so similar. It would certainly be easier than a parser for 3D models or actual music with audio playback (I'm pretty sure I know how I would do both of those, but certainly not going to be able to do them all before the 24th).

## 12th of February, 2025

Got the project viewer working, albeit with still some work to go (e.g. no CSS yet). I made a way to dynamically load any kind of file with `FetchFile()`, which calls a file-specific fetch function based on file extension. Some supported file types don't actually need to be fetched, e.g. images, since the HTML can load them (i.e., `<img src="[path]"></img>`).

After the 2 days research on HTML sanitization, safe sinks, 3rd-party libraries, and a quick refresher on XSS attacks, I decided on using the `marked` package to convert fetched Markdown to HTML, and sanitizing with the `domPurify` package. It then gets loaded in the LIT component with the `unsafeHTML(``)` LIT directive, which I am a tad bit apprehensive about, but I'm pretty sure the sanitization and my other measures plug the security holes `unsafeHTML(``)` creates (this is a static site after all, i.e., one that takes no user input).

One thing that is really low priority is that the only way I have currently found to statically load LIT's `unsafeHTML(``)` directive is to load the ENTIRE LIT package, which produces a console warning in the page, which is kind of annoying.

## 13th of February, 2025

Waking up today, I saw that my computer decided to have an OS update without my knowledge or input, which meant what little researching tabs I had were gone. I couldn't recover them because I usually use incognito mode (mostly out of habit), and just leave the tabs I need open (they persist with my computer off).  
Nothing major lost though, as I can find most of them again, and the few I lost are no big deal.

It's great coming back from a night's rest and realising your fix from the previous day turns out to actually have not fixed the problem, and you can see exactly why it didn't.

## 14th of February, 2025

I've spent most of yesterday and some of today trying to detect and handle the CSS animation for it to coincide with the project viewer. After a *lot* of fiddling and learning from online docs and examples with JavaScript's (frankly annoying) asynchronous code capabilities, it turned out to be as simple as the fact that CSS animations have an event for when animations start and end.

I also then thought "well, since the shrinking animation still doesn't account for scrolling the screen, I may as well do that while I'm here since it isn't that different!". It turns out animations don't have an event for DURING an animation, only start and end.  
This led to *EVEN MORE* fiddling with JavaScript `Promise`s, `await`s, security risks of `setTimeout()`, and even the weird scoping of the `this` keyword with not only asyncronicity, but with events *and* LIT elements.  
Eventually I was able to do away with all that by just listening for when the screen scrolls.

As I am writing this, the project viewer now coincides with the CSS animation, but still needs some work, like it covering the shrink project button, or that the page still scrolls behind it, and even takes precedence.

For some reason, if you click the "ignore all" filter button more than once, it *DOES NOT* update the filter tags' visual filter, but still filters correctly anyway. **BY ALL ACCOUNTS there is no way this should happen.** The way I fixed it is to forcibly get the tags and forcibly set their filters, which defeated the whole purpose of setting them through the LIT `render()` function.

I've also had a good amount of trouble with the project viewer prev and next buttons, because I wanted them to be arrow buttons, e.g. "◀" (`&#x25C0`) and "▶" (`&#x25B6`).  
The main two issues were to keep them square AND at the same height, and that every unicode arrow I found was designed to vertically align with text, so the space above them was larger than below.  
In fact, the only vertically centered unicode character I could find was the interpunct "·" (`U+00B7`).

## 15th of February, 2025

Took a break.

## 16th of February, 2025

Took a break. I was considering working on the project, but didn't get around to it.

## 17th of February, 2025

After realising I was wasting time on the 14th, I have decided to just use "prev" and "next" as labels.  
I didn't want to as the width of the buttons would be uneven, but if I can get the shrink button to center, and the other two to orbit, then it should be fine.

After some grueling CSS, I moved on to getting the prev and next buttons to work. I'm still not entirely sure if I followed best practices, but it's hard to know with inherently-lax languages like JavaScript and CSS.

## 18th of February, 2025

Yesterday I noticed that the filtering has broken. I have determined it to be a multitide of factors, but they for some reason stem from one change, when I made the project list items save their index into the array of *currently filtered* projects (`DisplayedProjectsIndexes[]`), when previously they had their index into the array of *every* project (`AllProjects[]`).  
I know this is the issue because, firstly, checked via GIT version control, and also because via `console.log()` I noticed that everything is working until the LIT `render()` function where it gets the project data to display, but it indexes as if it was into `AllProjects[]`, even though should be into `DisplayedProjectsIndexes[]`. ALSO, sometimes changing a filter just... doesn't update itself when it should.  
I made this index change because there wasn't a clean way to get a project's `DisplayedProjectsIndexes[]` index when it only stored the index into `AllProjects[]`, but is easy the other way, since `DisplayedProjectsIndexes[]` stores the *indexes into* `AllProjects[]`.  
Unfortunately, because I don't have total control over everything (because LIT components), I don't entirely know why it is like this, because as far as I can tell this shouldn't be happening. This is why I prefer total control, and probably why I didn't start this project with LIT.

## 19th of February, 2025

After considering that I've wasted too much time trying to convince JavaScript to let me to make my code better, I'm going to change back the filtering index thing that I talked about on the 18th. I won't rid that commit, rather Git has the ability to 'revert' a commit, which makes a new commit that undoes what that other commit did.
