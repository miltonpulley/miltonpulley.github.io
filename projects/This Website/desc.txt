On the 30th of January 2025, I finally decided to create a website portfolio during the break between University terms.
A portfolio had been something I planned to make ever since many at TAFE (and many since) have pointed out the benefits of one.
My University's IT faculty had a conference day of sorts during the end-of-year holidays where, among other things, attended a
presentation of creating a portfolio. From there I got the idea to use Github Pages, to reflect on assessments, show what didn't
work and why, problem solving, teamwork, communication, and not so much on technical prowess. The presentation also showed
"Beautiful Jekyll", which helps to quickly construct a website, but I chose to write my own HTML/CSS/JS. I didn't need to make
this website myself but I thought it would be a fun exercise, and because I can (and also I prefer total control over the underlying
functionality, which is why I would rather write my own video game engine rather than an off-the-shelf one).

This paragraph (and the previous) I am writing on the 31st, before I know how to do things like css animation, but I'll figure it out.
I probably won't do a datastore with SQL since that feels a bit overkill, I'll probably just fetch from file.
The filtering being done by buttons and not a searchbar is because I currently do not feel like sanitising inputs and protecting against
injection attacks (even though I'm sure other attacks are still possible, assuming Github Pages doesn't already protect against that stuff anyway).
The main priority is getting the site in a workable state, as I only have 4 weeks (which is plenty of time but I don't want to get sidetracked and fall victim to scope-creep).
